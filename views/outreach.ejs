                                We Cusatians believe that being a good engineer is not just about excelling in academics and building technologies. It also involves a humanitarian aspect of giving back to the society and making them a part of our professional journey. Hence we want our folks in and around to know our vision and what the future holds. Our team undertakes initiatives such as the introduction of technology to the high school students, social events like clean up campaigns and many more. Connecting with the best organizations, companies, entrepreneurs and individuals will help us and the people around us, entering us in perpetual learning and development process, which is essential for the country and our people.

                                We are well aware of our social responsibilities as aspiring engineers. Not only in technical field, we know our responsibilities span in all spheres of life. It's hard for us to not notice what our earth is suffering from. So we have decided to show our concern and action on 18th January 2020. About a hundred volunteers from School Of Engineering, Cusat, will clean Fort Kochi beach. We'll also see how this collected waste can be effectively utilised.Along with that there will be a flash mob and also other events for entertainment. We are giving the amount collected from the activities to Solace, a charity programme. This undoubtedly is a very social concerned event, with a lot of goodness in its very vision. It resonates with our motto, that we will build a better world.

                                Quiz, the mind sport, is one of the most popular events conducted across the globe. It not only urges young minds to crave for exciting prizes offered, but also helps in improving their critical thinking and gives them an opportunity to hone their teamwork skills. 
In this context, Dhishna 2020 offers such an interactive platform, Inquizition, for all those ignited minds in our very own CUSAT campus.
Inquizition is open to students of all classes, where they can participate as a team of two members. The competition will be conducted in two rounds and six teams will qualify for the finale. Exciting prizes await the winners of Inquizition Dhishna 2020.
We aim at encouraging students to look beyond their textual knowledge and establish a relationship between theory and application of learned concepts. We invite all those enthusiastic learners to join this quest of knowledge.
